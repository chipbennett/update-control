== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't this Plugin have its own settings page? =

Plugin settings can be found under Settings -> General.

Not having a separate settings page is a decision based on UI philosophy. The Plugin simply isn't complex enough to warrant a separate settings page. Perhaps a different admin page, such as Dashboard -> Updates, would be more appropriate; however, core does not provide a way to hook into that page to add settings sections.

= How do I use this Plugin in a multisite network? =

Activate the Plugin on the main network site, and configure options via Settings -> General.

= What do "Minor", "Major", and "Development" core updates mean? =

* "Minor": minor versions will be updated automatically. Minor versions in WordPress are "X.Y.Z". A minor-version update is a change from "X.Y.Z" to "X.Y.Z+1". This is the default core behavior.
* "Major": major versions will be updated automatically. Major versiosn in WordPress are "X.Y". A major-version update is a change from "X.Y" to "X.Y+1".
* "Development": development versions will be updated automatically. Development versions, also referred to as "bleeding-edge nightlies", are daily updates in the current development branch. While usually quite stable, this option should be used only if you're comfortable with using potentially unstable, development software. This option should only be used on production sites if your name is "Otto".

= Which setting should I use? =

Core Updates:

* If you want minor versions to update automatically (default WordPress core behavior): leave "Automatic Core Update Level?" set to "Minor".
* If you want both minor and major versions to update automatically: set "Automatic Core Update Level?" to "Major".
* If you want bleeding-edge nightlies: set "Automatic Core Update Level?" to "Development"
* If you want to disable core updates altogether: set "Automatic Updates Enabled?" to "no"

Plugin/Theme/Translation Updates:

* If you disable updates, Plugin, Theme, and Translation updates will also be disabled
* Separately enable Plugin, Theme, and Translation updates via the appropriate checkboxes

Update Result Emails

* By default, WordPress sends an update result email for successful, failed, and critically failed updates
* Selectively disable emails for each result type via the appropriate checkboxes
